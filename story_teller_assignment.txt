Assignment: Building an LLM-Powered Application

Objective:
Participants will apply their learning from the course by building an AI-powered application using models offered by DeepInfra. The goal is to develop an application that allows users to generate personalized stories based on their inputs, similar to an AI-driven interactive storytelling platform.

Assignment Overview:
The application should leverage models available on DeepInfra.
The app should include a frontend (UI) where users can provide inputs and receive AI-generated content.
The backend should handle interactions with the LLM, process user inputs, and generate relevant outputs.
Participants should focus on response quality

Key Features to Include:
User Input Mechanism: A simple and intuitive UI for users to get required inputs
LLM Interaction: The backend should communicate with DeepInfra models to generate responses.
Personalized Content Generation: The AI should tailor responses based on user input.

Example Inputs:
Genre: Users select a genre such as fantasy, mystery, or sci-fi to shape the style of the story.
Number of Characters: User can get the number of characters as input, It could be a count or names
Number of Paragraph/Sections: User get the number of paragraph as limit for the Story.

Expected Outcomes:
By completing this assignment, participants will:
Gain hands-on experience in integrating LLMs into real-world applications.
Learn to interface with DeepInfra APIs and handle AI-driven workflows.
Build a functional AI-powered application that demonstrates creativity and problem-solving.
Understand challenges like latency, prompt engineering, and response optimization.

Good Add-on:
Generate an individual Image per paragraph based on the content (as part of the first request)
Give a summary/preface
Implement additional changes on top of the first story generated
